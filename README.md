### Step-by-Step Instructions to Compile and Run on Linux

1. **Install Kernel Headers**:
   Ensure that the kernel headers are installed on your system. You can install them using the following command:
   ```sh
   sudo apt-get install linux-headers-$(uname -r)
   ```

2. **Create a Makefile**:
   Create a `Makefile` in the same directory as your OSprojV2.c file. The `Makefile` should contain the following content:
   ```makefile
   obj-m += OSprojV2.o

   KDIR := /lib/modules/$(shell uname -r)/build
   PWD := $(shell pwd)

   all:
       $(MAKE) -C $(KDIR) M=$(PWD) modules

   clean:
       $(MAKE) -C $(KDIR) M=$(PWD) clean
   ```

3. **Compile the Module**:
   Open a terminal and navigate to the directory containing your OSprojV2.c and `Makefile`. Run the following command to compile the module:
   ```sh
   make
   ```

4. **Insert the Module**:
   After compiling, insert the module into the kernel using the following command:
   ```sh
   sudo insmod OSprojV2.ko
   ```

5. **Check Kernel Logs**:
   Verify that the module has been loaded correctly by checking the kernel logs:
   ```sh
   dmesg | tail
   ```

6. **Access the /proc Entry**:
   You can read the system health metrics by accessing the `/proc/sys/sys_health` file:
   ```sh
   cat /proc/sys/sys_health
   ```

7. **Remove the Module**:
   When you are done, you can remove the module using the following command:
   ```sh
   sudo rmmod OSprojV2
   ```

8. **Clean Up**:
   Clean up the build files using the following command:
   ```sh
   make clean
   ```

By following these steps, you should be able to compile and run your kernel module on a Linux system.
